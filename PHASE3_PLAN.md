```

#### 2.2 Create Notice Pages
```
client/src/pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ NoticesPage.js        # Main notices management page

## Timeline Estimate
- **Total time**: 8-12 hours
- **Step 1**: 2-3 hours (Polling frontend)
- **Step 2**: 2-3 hours (Notice frontend)
- **Step 3**: 1-2 hours (PDF upload)
- **Step 4**: 2-3 hours (Workflow integration)
- **Step 5**: 1-2 hours (Dashboard and analytics)

## Next Steps
1. Start with polling system frontend components
2. Test each component thoroughly before moving to next
3. Make incremental commits to track progress
4. Focus on user experience and workflow clarity
5. Ensure all email and file handling is secure and reliable
